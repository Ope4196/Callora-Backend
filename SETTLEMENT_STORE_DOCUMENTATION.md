# Settlement Store Invariants and Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the invariants, persistence semantics, and testing approach for the `InMemorySettlementStore` implementation. The tests ensure data integrity, proper state transitions, and resistance to corruption.

## Core Invariants

### 1. Data Persistence Invariants
- **Settlement Immutability**: Once created, settlement core fields (`id`, `developerId`, `amount`, `created_at`) never change
- **Status Mutability**: Only `status` and `tx_hash` fields can be modified after creation
- **Ordering Guarantee**: Settlements are always returned in descending `created_at` order (newest first)
- **Developer Isolation**: Settlements are strictly isolated by `developerId`

### 2. Deduplication Invariants
- **ID-Based Storage**: The store does not enforce ID uniqueness at the storage layer
- **Application-Level Deduplication**: ID uniqueness must be enforced by calling code (e.g., `RevenueSettlementService`)
- **Multiple Same-ID Records**: Multiple settlements with identical IDs can coexist in storage

### 3. Status Transition Invariants
- **All Transitions Allowed**: The store permits any status transition (`pending` ↔ `completed` ↔ `failed`)
- **Transaction Hash Preservation**: `tx_hash` is preserved when not explicitly provided in updates
- **Null Hash Support**: `tx_hash` can be explicitly set to `null`

### 4. Data Integrity Invariants
- **Type Safety**: All fields maintain their TypeScript types
- **Edge Case Handling**: Store handles edge values (empty strings, zero amounts, negative amounts)
- **No Data Loss**: Operations never result in data loss or corruption

## Concurrency Expectations

### Current Limitations
The `InMemorySettlementStore` is **NOT thread-safe** and provides no concurrency guarantees:

1. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent modifications can result in data loss or corruption
2. **No Atomic Operations**: Multi-step operations are not atomic
3. **Read-Modify-Write Hazards**: Status updates are not atomic with respect to reads

### Production Requirements
For production use with concurrent access, the following would be required:

1. **Database Backing**: Replace in-memory storage with a proper database
2. **Transaction Isolation**: Use database transactions for atomic operations
3. **Optimistic Locking**: Implement version-based conflict resolution
4. **Connection Pooling**: Manage concurrent database access safely

## Security and Data Integrity Notes

### Critical Observations

1. **No Built-in Validation**: The store accepts any settlement data without validation
   - Business logic validation must occur at the service layer
   - Negative amounts, empty IDs, and invalid dates are accepted

2. **ID Collision Risk**: Multiple settlements with same ID can exist
   - This could lead to ambiguity in status updates
   - Application must ensure unique ID generation

3. **Memory Limitations**: In-memory storage is bounded by available memory
   - No automatic cleanup or archival mechanisms
   - Potential for memory leaks in long-running processes

### Recommendations

1. **Add Validation Layer**: Implement settlement validation before storage
2. **Enforce ID Uniqueness**: Add constraints to prevent duplicate IDs
3. **Implement Archival**: Add mechanisms to archive old settlements
4. **Add Monitoring**: Track settlement counts and memory usage

## Test Coverage Summary

### Status Transition Tests ✅
- All valid status transitions
- Transaction hash handling
- Non-existent settlement handling
- Hash preservation behavior

### Data Integrity Tests ✅
- Multi-operation consistency
- Edge case value handling
- Large amount handling
- Negative amount handling

### Concurrency Tests ✅
- Thread-safety documentation
- Rapid sequential operations
- Race condition scenarios

### Integration Tests ✅
- RevenueSettlementService compatibility
- Settlement lifecycle validation
- ID format compliance

## Security Considerations

### High Priority
1. **Input Validation**: No validation of settlement data before storage
2. **ID Uniqueness**: No enforcement of unique settlement IDs
3. **Memory Exhaustion**: No protection against memory-based DoS

### Medium Priority
1. **Data Leakage**: In-memory data persists until explicitly cleared
2. **Audit Trail**: No logging of settlement modifications
3. **Access Control**: No built-in access restrictions

### Low Priority
1. **Information Disclosure**: Error messages may reveal internal state
2. **Resource Monitoring**: No metrics on storage usage

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- `create()`: O(1) - Array push operation
- `updateStatus()`: O(n) - Linear search by ID
- `getDeveloperSettlements()`: O(n log n) - Filter + sort

### Space Complexity
- O(n) where n is the number of settlements stored
- No automatic cleanup or compaction

## Migration Path

For production deployment, consider this migration sequence:

1. **Phase 1**: Add validation layer to existing in-memory store
2. **Phase 2**: Implement ID uniqueness constraints
3. **Phase 3**: Add persistence layer (database)
4. **Phase 4**: Implement proper concurrency controls
5. **Phase 5**: Add monitoring and alerting

## Testing Environment

The tests are designed to run in:
- Node.js with Jest testing framework
- TypeScript compilation environment
- In-memory test isolation (each test gets a fresh store)

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm test -- settlementStore # Run only settlement store tests
npm run lint               # Check code style
npm run typecheck          # Verify TypeScript types
```

## Conclusion

The `InMemorySettlementStore` provides a solid foundation for development and testing but requires significant enhancements for production use. The comprehensive test suite ensures current behavior is well-documented and any regressions will be caught immediately.

Key takeaways:
- Current implementation is suitable for development/testing only
- Production use requires database backing and concurrency controls
- `PostgresSettlementStore` now provides that backing while preserving external settlement IDs through `settlements.external_id`
- Persistent developer revenue also depends on `revenue_ledger` so unsettled usage continues to satisfy `total_earned = completed + pending + usage` after restarts
- Security concerns must be addressed at the application layer
- Test coverage provides confidence in current behavior guarantees
